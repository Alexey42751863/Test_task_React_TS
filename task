Try to build a small quiz app where user gets asked questions and have 4 answer choices per question.
Users should be able to answer questions, navigate backwards and forwards between questions and see their score after answering the last question.
Either of the apps should be built using React, Typescript, SCSS (preferably with CSS modules instead of global CSS classes)
